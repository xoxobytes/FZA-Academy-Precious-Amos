            Yea, and I can't feel my legs, I'm a paraplegic
            Lord, I want a fair one with my demons
            Karen Meyers became married to Jesus
            Born dead, they had to dig up my fetus
            And now the devil want to tear me to pieces
            I'm a diagnosed insomniac
            An astronaut who blasted off into the stars galactic
            On top of Saturn, fox-trotting with Velociraptors
            The dino-aliens invaded Earth, so they could feed on hypochondriacs
            Preparing for the rapture, closet hillbilly threw the spinners on the tractor
            I listen to Uncle Kracker
            But, that's white America for you, we all that matters
            I'm walking backwards, shadowboxing with karate masters
            It's more to rap, we sell the royal crack at Castle Rock
            A bad apple like an unemployed Macintosh
            We lost Jobs
            Now they brainwashed with dot com
            It's only so long until we surrender the free world to Hong Kong
            
            And sinners stay still, but the merry go 'round, and 'round
            It all just keeps spinning
            Gotta keep swimming
            Eat drink and let the merry go 'round
            Eat drink and let the merry go 'round
            
            I got a double sided silver dollar
            Larry Fish here from midget league, beginner slaughter
            I'm not drowning, I'm wading in the water
            Killing off these monsters ever since I was a Sabra
            I got horses on my pjs
            Shout to spitta jet life, I fit the Porsches on the pjs
            On stage, sending dark forces to my DJ
            The birdies on tour like PGA
            Davis Love III, Pittsburgh warrior
            Bullets in my cornea
            In exelsis Deo, ayo, this is Gloria
            Ave, Ave Maria, I'm getting bread, yeast rise on Easter
            Money is God
            Black beaches with jungle fever I love to be on
            You on the B-Team I fuck with Solange
            All my life they said I doesn't belong
            So I'm chilling, growing drugs on my lawn
            
            And sinners stay still, but the merry go 'round, and 'round
            It all just keeps spinning
            Gotta keep swimming
            Eat drink and let the merry go 'round
            Eat drink and let the merry go 'round
            
            Yeah, what what
            Have you found a way out?
            Have you found a way out?
            Vacation in Slovakia, celebrating Mardi Gras
            Eating baklava and lobster claw at the Ramada
            With a Mafia of immigrants
            Finna take 'em on a pilgrimage
            Have you found a way out?
